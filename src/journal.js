// <!-- Single Journal Entry You defined form fields for the following bits of data to collect from a user of your application. Date of the journal entry. Concepts covered (which will be the title of the entry). The long-form contents of the journal entry. The mood of the journal entry. In your JavaScript file, define an object that will represent a journal entry in your code. /* Define the keys and value for a JavaScript object that represents a journal entry about what you learned today */ const journalEntry
// = {}
// Journal Entry Collection 
// Eventually, you will have multiple journal entries, so you need to define an appropriately named variable that will have the value of an array.Once you define that variable and give it a
// default value of a blank array,
// use the push() method to add the journalEntry object you defined above to the array.More Journal Entries Take a few minutes and define two or three more JavaScript objects to represent journal entries
// for some other things that you have learned about
// so far at NSS.Add those new objects to your journal entries array. -->
